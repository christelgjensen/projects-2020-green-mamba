# Data analysis project

Our project is titled analysis of the commute in Denmark.
In this project we want to investigate the amount of commute in Denmark, both by looking at the long commuters and also on the general commuting.

The analysis of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We used data pendling1.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanekn.dk/

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``

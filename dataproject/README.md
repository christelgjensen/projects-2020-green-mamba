# Data analysis project

Our project is titled analysis of the commute in Denmark.
In this project we want to investigate the amount of commute in Denmark, both by looking at the long distance commuters and also on the general commuting.

The analysis of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We used data pendling1.xlsx downloaded from statistikbanken.dk/

The final conclusion of the procejt is:
The amount of people with a long commute (more than 50 km) are at East Jutland and Copenhagen. This makes sense since the two biggest cities in Denmark are located here and therefore there might be more job opportunities here. Moreover we found that the most common amount of commute is 0-5 km.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``

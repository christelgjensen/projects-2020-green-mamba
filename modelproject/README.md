# Model analysis project

Our project is titled the Solow Models and is presenting the General Solow model and the extended version with human capital. We start by defining the General Solow model, then we find the transition- and solow equation in order to find the steady state. To conclude our analysis of the General Solow model, we have made an interactive graph, showing how a change in one of the parameters, will change the curve of General Solow model and its steady state. Lastly we extend the General Solow model by adding human capital. Here we have created a graph, that shows capital and human capital accumulation.

The models and the results of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
